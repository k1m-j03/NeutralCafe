## Overview  
The #Neutral Reservation App# 
The scenario addressed by this application revolves around a popular restaurant that faces challenges in managing large reservation demands. 
Customers need to book tables at least one week in advance to secure their preferred seating options. 
The app provides a user-friendly platform where customers can choose between indoor or outdoor seating, with additional options for scenic views such as the sea or garden. 
Tables can accommodate up to 10 people, catering to both small groups and large gatherings.

The primary users of the system are restaurant customers. The app allows them to:
-	Create an account and log in.
-	View available tables and seating options.
-	Make, edit, or cancel reservations.
-	Receive updates about reservation status (approval, decline, or changes).
-	Manage notification preferences for reservation updates.

By addressing these needs, the application ensures a smoother reservation experience for users while helping the restaurant optimize its seating management and improve customer satisfaction.
